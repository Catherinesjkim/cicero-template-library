4. LICENSE ISSUE FEE/MAINTENANCE FEES

4.1 Licensee will pay to The Regents a non-creditable, non-refundable license issue fee (“License
Issue Fee”) of {{licenseIssueFeeText}} dollars (${{licenseIssueFeeAmount}}) due upon execution of this Agreement. The License Issue Fee is non-refundable and not an advance against royalties or other payments due under this Agreement.

4.2 Licensee will pay to The Regents a license maintenance fee of {{licenseMFeeText}} dollars
(${{licenseMFeeRate}}) by the {{licenseMFeeDuration}} of the Effective Date and by each anniversary of the
Effective Date thereafter until the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which
the first Sale of Licensed Products or Licensed Services takes place.

5. ROYALTIES

5.1 Licensee will pay to The Regents earned royalties (“Earned Royalties”) at the rate of {{earnedRoyaltyText }} percent ({{earnedRoyaltyRate}}%) of the Net Sales of all Licensed Products and Licensed Services.

5.2 Earned Royalties accruing to The Regents will be paid to The Regents, to be accompanied by the corresponding royalty report as required in Paragraph 7.4, quarterly within sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter as follows: May 31 (for first quarter), August 31 (for second quarter), November 30 (for third quarter), and February 28 (for fourth quarter).

5.3 Beginning in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the first Sale of Licensed Products or Licensed Services takes place, and in each calendar year thereafter, Licensee will pay to The Regents a minimum annual royalty (“Minimum Annual Royalty”) of {{minimumAnnualRoyaltyText}} dollars (${{minimumAnnualRoyaltyRate}}) for the life of this Agreement. The Minimum Annual Royalty will be paid to The Regents by February 28 of each year and will be credited against the Earned Royalties due and owing for the calendar year for which the Minimum Annual Royalty is made.

5.4 All payments due The Regents will be payable in United States dollars. When Licensed Products and Licensed Services are Sold for monies other than United States dollars, Earned Royalties will first be determined in the foreign currency of the country in which the Sale was made and then converted into equivalent United States dollars. The exchange rate will be that rate quoted in the Wall Street Journal on the last business day of the reporting period.

5.5 Earned Royalty payments due to The Regents for Sales occurring in any country outside the United States will not be reduced by any taxes, fees, or other charges imposed by the government of such country on the remittance of royalty income. Licensee will also be responsible for all bank transfer charges for payments to The Regents.

5.6 Licensee will make all payments under this Agreement either by check or electronic transfer, payable to “The Regents of the University of California” and Licensee will forward such payments to The Regents at the address shown in Paragraph 23.1.

5.7 If any patent or patent application, or any claim thereof, included within Patent Rights expires, or is held invalid or unpatentable in a final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction and last resort and from which no appeal has been or can be taken, all obligations to pay Earned Royalties based on such patent, patent application, or claim will cease as of the date of such expiration or final decision. Licensee will not, however, be relieved from paying any Earned Royalties that accrued before such expiration or final decision or that are based on another patent, patent application, or claim within Patent Rights which is not expired, or which is not held invalid or unpatentable in such final decision.

6. DILIGENCE

6.1 Licensee will diligently proceed with the development, manufacture, marketing, and Sale of Licensed Products and Licensed Services in quantities sufficient to meet the market demand.

6.2 In addition to Licensee’s obligations under Paragraph 6.1, Licensee will accomplish the following milestones in Licensee’s activities under this Agreement: 

{{milestonesDescription}}.

6.3 If Licensee is unable to meet any of its diligence obligations set forth in Paragraphs 6.1 and 6.2, then The Regents will so notify Licensee of failure to perform. Licensee will have the right and option to extend the target date of any such diligence obligation for a period of six (6) months upon the payment of {{amountText}} dollars (${{amount}}) within the thirty (30)-day period prior to the
date to be extended, for each such extension option exercised by Licensee. Licensee may further extend the target date of any diligence obligation for an additional six (6) months upon payment of an additional {{amountText}} dollars (${{amount}}). Additional extensions may be granted
only by written agreement of the Parties. These payments are in addition to any other payments owed under this Agreement. Should Licensee opt not to extend the obligation or fail to meet the obligation by the extended target date, then The Regents will have the right and option either to
terminate this Agreement or to reduce Licensee's exclusive license to a non-exclusive license. This right, if exercised by The Regents, supersedes the rights granted in Article 2 (Grant).

6.4 To exercise either the right to terminate this Agreement or to reduce the license to a nonexclusive license for lack of diligence under Paragraph 6.1 or 6.2, The Regents will give Licensee written notice of the deficiency. Licensee thereafter will have sixty (60) days to cure the deficiency. If The Regents has not received satisfactory written evidence that the deficiency has been cured by the end of the sixty (60)-day period, then The Regents may, at its option, either terminate the Agreement or reduce Licensee's exclusive license to a non-exclusive license by giving written notice to Licensee. These notices will be subject to Article 22 (Notices).

7. PROGRESS AND ROYALTY REPORTS

7.1 For the six (6)-month period beginning {{reportDate}}, within sixty (60) days of each June 30 and December 31 following the end of such six (6)-month period, Licensee will submit to The Regents a semi-annual progress report covering Licensee's activities related to the development and testing of Licensed Products, Licensed Services, and Licensed Methods, including the obtaining of necessary governmental approvals, if any, for marketing in the United
States. These progress reports will be made until the first Sale occurs in the United States.

7.2 Each progress report will be a sufficiently detailed summary of activities of Licensee and any Sublicensees so that The Regents may evaluate and determine Licensee’s progress in the development of Licensed Products, Licensed Services, and Licensed Methods, and in meeting Licensee’s diligence obligations under Article 6, and will include (but not be limited to) the following: (a) summary of work completed and in progress; (b) current schedule of anticipated events and milestones, including diligence milestones under Paragraph 6.2; (c) anticipated market introduction dates for the Licensed Territory; and (d) Sublicensees’ activities during the reporting period.

7.3 In Licensee’s progress report immediately subsequent to the first Sale of a Licensed Product or a Licensed Service by Licensee or by a Sublicensee, Licensee will report the date of such first Sale.

7.4 After the first Sale of a Licensed Product or a Licensed Service, Licensee will make quarterly royalty reports to The Regents, to be accompanied by the corresponding Earned Royalty payment as required in Paragraph 5.2, within sixty (60) days after the quarters ending March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, of each year. Each such royalty report will include at least the following:

	(a) the volume of Licensed Products and Licensed Services Sold;
	(b) gross revenue from Sale of Licensed Products and Licensed Services;
	(c) Net Sales pursuant to Paragraph 1.7, and the calculation of Net Sales, including all
	deductions taken, so that The Regents can confirm the calculation;
	(d) total Earned Royalties due The Regents; and
	(e) names and addresses of Sublicensees for any new Sublicenses entered into during the
	reporting quarter.

7.5 If no Sales of Licensed Products or Licensed Services have occurred during the report period, the royalty report will contain a statement to this effect.

8. BOOKS AND RECORDS

8.1 Licensee will keep full, true, and accurate books of accounts containing all particulars that may be necessary for the purpose of showing (a) the amount of Earned Royalties payable to The Regents, and (b) Licensee’s compliance with obligations under this Agreement. For five (5) years following the end of the calendar year to which they pertain, said books and the supporting data will be open, during normal business hours upon reasonable notice, to the inspection and audit  by representatives of The Regents for the purpose of verifying Licensee's royalty reports or compliance in other respects with this Agreement. Such representatives will be required to hold all information in confidence except as necessary to communicate Licensee's non-compliance with this Agreement to The Regents.

8.2 The fees and expenses of The Regents' representatives performing such an examination will be borne by The Regents, provided that if an error in underpaid royalties to The Regents of more than {{royaltyText}} percent ({{royaltyRate}}%) of the total Earned Royalties due for any year is discovered, then the fees and expenses of these representatives in conducting such examination will be borne by Licensee.

9. LIFE OF THE AGREEMENT

9.1 Unless otherwise terminated by operation of law or by acts of the Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, this Agreement will be in effect from the Effective Date and will remain in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent or last-to-be-abandoned patent application licensed under this Agreement, whichever is later.

10. TERMINATION BY THE REGENTS

10.1 If Licensee should violate or fail to perform any term of this Agreement, then The Regents may give written notice of such default (“Notice of Default”) to Licensee. If Licensee should fail to repair such default within sixty (60) days of the effective date of such notice, The Regents will have the right to terminate this Agreement and the licenses herein by a second written notice (“Notice of Termination”) to Licensee. If a Notice of Termination is sent to Licensee, this Agreement will automatically terminate on the effective date of such notice. Such termination will not relieve Licensee of Licensee’s obligation to pay any royalty or license fees owing at the time of such termination and will not impair any accrued rights of The Regents. These notices will be
subject to Article 22 (Notices).

10.2 Notwithstanding Paragraph 10.1, this Agreement will terminate immediately, if Licensee files a claim including in any way the assertion that any portion of Patent Rights is invalid or unenforceable, where the filing of such claim is by Licensee, by a third party on behalf of Licensee, or by a third party at the urging of Licensee.

10.3 Notwithstanding Paragraph 10.1, this Agreement will terminate immediately in the event of the filing of a petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code by or against Licensee as a debtor or alleged debtor.

11. TERMINATION BY LICENSEE

11.1 Licensee will have the right at any time to terminate this Agreement in whole or as to any portion of Patent Rights by giving notice in writing to The Regents. Such notice of termination will be subject to Article 22 (Notices) and such termination of this Agreement in whole or in part will be effective ninety (90) days after the effective date of such notice of termination.

11.2 Any termination pursuant to Paragraph 11.1 will not relieve Licensee of any obligation or liability accrued hereunder prior to such termination or rescind anything done by Licensee or any
payments made to The Regents hereunder prior to the time such termination becomes effective, and such termination will not affect in any manner any rights of The Regents arising under this Agreement prior to such termination.

12. DISPOSITION OF LICENSED PRODUCTS UPON TERMINATION

12.1 Upon termination of this Agreement, for a period of one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date of termination, Licensee may complete the making of, and may Sell, any partially made Licensed Products, and Licensee may continue the practice of Licensed Methods only to the extent necessary to do the foregoing; provided that all such Sales will be subject to the terms of this Agreement including, but not limited to, the payment of royalties at tthe rate and at the time provided herein and the rendering of reports thereon. 

13. PATENT PROSECUTION AND MAINTENANCE 

13.1 The Regents will prosecute and maintain the patent applications and patents under Patent Rights, subject to Licensee’s reimbursement of The Regents’ out-of-pocket costs under Paragraph 13.3. All patent applications and patents under Patent Rights will be held in the name of The Regents. The Regents will have sole responsibility for retaining and instructing patent counsel. The Regents will promptly provide Licensee with copies of all official patent office correspondence, and Licensee agrees to keep this documentation confidential in accordance with Article 25 (Confidentiality). Licensee may comment upon such documentation, and The Regents will take such comments into account, provided that if Licensee has not commented upon such documentation in reasonable time for The Regents to sufficiently consider Licensee’s comments prior to the deadline for filing a response with the relevant government patent office, The Regents will be free to respond appropriately without consideration of Licensee's comments. 

13.2 The Regents will use reasonable efforts to prepare or amend any patent application within Patent Rights to include claims reasonably requested by Licensee to protect the Licensed Products or Licensed Services contemplated to be Sold or Licensed Methods to be practiced under this Agreement.

13.3 Subject to Paragraph 13.4, all past, present, and future costs for preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all patent applications and patents under Patent Rights (including, without limitation, the cost of interferences, reexaminations, oppositions, post-grant review, inter partes review, supplemental examinations, and other patent office administrative proceedings, and their appeals), which have not been previously reimbursed to The Regents, will be paid by Licensee, so long as the licenses granted to Licensee herein are exclusive. Such payments by Licensee for such costs are due within thirty (30) days after receipt by Licensee of invoice from The Regents. If, however, The Regents reduces the exclusive licenses granted herein to non-exclusive licenses pursuant to Paragraph 6.3 or Paragraph 6.4, and The Regents grants one or more additional licenses, the subsequent costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining such patent applications and patents will be divided equally among the licensed parties from the effective date of each subsequently granted license agreement. 

13.4 Licensee's obligation to pay all patent preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance costs for Patent Rights will continue for so long as this Agreement remains in effect, provided that Licensee may terminate Licensee’s obligations with respect to any given patent application or patent under Patent Rights in any designated country upon three (3) months’ written notice to The Regents. In the event of such notice to The Regents, The Regents will undertake to curtail applicable patent costs billable to Licensee.

Unless required by law or consented to in writing by The Regents, Licensee will not use the name “The Regents of the University of California” or the name of any University of California campus in advertising, publicity, or other promotional activities. 

16. LIMITED WARRANTIES 

16.1 The Regents warrants to Licensee that The Regents has the lawful right to grant this license.

WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY OTHER WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE REGENTS MAKES NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT PRACTICE OF THE INVENTION OR PATENT RIGHTS (INCLUDING MAKING, USING, SELLING, OFFERING TO SELL, OR IMPORTING LICENSED PRODUCTS, LICENSED SERVICES, OR LICENSED METHODS) WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHT. 

16.3 IN NO EVENT WILL THE REGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR 
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RESULTING FROM EXERCISE OF THIS LICENSE OR A SUBLICENSE, OR THE USE OF THE INVENTION, PATENT RIGHTS, LICENSED METHODS, LICENSED SERVICES, OR LICENSED PRODUCTS. 

16.4 Nothing in this Agreement is or will be construed as: 
(a) a warranty or representation by The Regents as to the patentability, validity, 
enforceability, or scope of Patent Rights; (b) a warranty or representation that anything made, used, Sold, offered for Sale, or imported under any license granted in this Agreement is or will be free from infringement of patents of third parties; (c) an obligation to bring or prosecute actions or suits against third parties for patent infringement; (d) conferring by implication, estoppel, or otherwise any license or rights under any patent applications or patents of The Regents other than Patent Rights, regardless of whether such patent applications or patents are dominant or subordinate to Patent Rights; or (e) an obligation to furnish any know-how not provided in the patents and patent applications under Patent Rights. 

17. PATENT INFRINGEMENT 

17.1 In the event that Licensee learns of the substantial infringement of any Patent Rights, Licensee will promptly provide The Regents with notice and reasonable evidence of such infringement (“Infringement Notice”). During the time period and in a jurisdiction where Licensee has exclusive rights under this Agreement, neither Party will notify a third party, including the infringer, of the infringement without first obtaining consent of the other Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties will use diligent efforts, in cooperation with each other, to terminate such infringement without litigation. 

17.2 (a) If such infringing activity has not been abated within ninety (90) days following the effective date of the Infringement Notice, Licensee may initiate suit for patent infringement against the infringer. The Regents may voluntarily join as a party in such suit at The Regents’ expense, but The Regents may not thereafter separately initiate suit against the infringer for the acts of infringement that are the subject of Licensee’s suit or any judgment rendered in that suit. Licensee may not cause The Regents to be joined as a party in a suit initiated by Licensee without The Regents’ prior written consent. If, in a suit initiated by Licensee, The Regents is involuntarily caused to be joined as a party, Licensee will pay any costs incurred by The Regents arising out of such suit, including, but not limited to, any legal fees of counsel that The Regents selects and retains to represent it in the suit. 
(b) If, within a hundred and twenty (120) days following the effective date of the Infringement Notice, the infringing activity has not been abated and if Licensee has not initiated suit against the infringer, The Regents may in its sole discretion initiate suit for patent infringement against the infringer. If The Regents initiates such suit, Licensee may not join such suit without The Regents’ consent, and Licensee may not thereafter separately initiate suit against the infringer for the acts of infringement that are the subject of The Regents’ suit or any judgment rendered in that suit. 

17.3 Such suit initiated under Paragraph 17.2 will be at the expense of the initiating Party and all recoveries recovered thereby will belong to such Party, provided that suits initiated jointly by The Regents and Licensee will be at the joint expense of the Parties and all recoveries will be allocated in the following order: (a) to each Party reimbursement for its attorneys' costs, fees, and other related out-of-pocket expenses, to the extent such Party paid for such costs, fees, and expenses until all such costs, fees, and expenses are consumed for such Party; and (b) any remaining amount shared jointly by the Parties in proportion to the share of expenses paid by each Party, but in no event will The Regents’ share be less than {{percentText}} percent ({{percentRate}}%) of such remaining amount. The foregoing notwithstanding, if such suit is initiated by Licensee and The Regents is not a party, The Regents’ share of any recoveries will be {{percentText}} percent ({{percent}}%) of the amount of such recoveries remaining after reimbursement to Licensee of Licensee’s attorneys’ costs, fees and other related out-of-pocket expenses. In any suit initiated by The Regents, any recovery will belong to The Regents. 

17.4 Each Party will cooperate with the other Party in litigation initiated hereunder but at the expense of the initiating Party. Such litigation will be controlled by the initiating Party bringing the action, except that The Regents may be represented by counsel of its choice in any suit initiated by Licensee. 

17.5 Any agreement made by Licensee for the purposes of settling litigation initiated hereunder or 
other related dispute will comply with the requirements of Article 3 (Sublicenses). In no event may Licensee admit liability or wrongdoing on behalf of The Regents without The Regents’ prior written consent. 

18. INDEMNIFICATION 

18.1 Licensee will, and will require Sublicensees to, indemnify, hold harmless, and defend The 
Regents and its officers, employees, and agents; sponsors of the research that led to the Invention; and the inventors of any patents and patent applications under Patent Rights and their employers; against any and all claims, suits, losses, damages, costs, fees, and expenses resulting from or arising out of exercise of this license or any Sublicense. This indemnification will include, but not be limited to, any product liability. 

18.2 Licensee, at its sole cost and expense, will insure its activities in connection with any work 
performed hereunder and will obtain, keep in force, and maintain the following insurance: 
(a) Commercial Form General Liability Insurance (contractual liability included) with limits as 
follows: 

Each Occurrence ...............................................................................${{amount}} Products/Completed Operations Aggregate .......................................................${{amount}} 
Personal and Advertising Injury ...............................................................${{amount}} General Aggregate .............................................................................${{amount}} 

If the above insurance is written on a claims-made form, it will continue for three (3) years following termination or expiration of this Agreement. The insurance will have a retroactive date of placement prior to or coinciding with the Effective Date of this Agreement; and 

(b) Worker's Compensation as legally required in the jurisdiction in which Licensee is doing 
business. 

18.3 The coverage and limits referred to in Subparagraphs 18.2(a) and 18.2(b) will not in any way limit the liability of Licensee under this Article 18 (Indemnification). Upon the execution of this Agreement, Licensee will furnish The Regents with certificates of insurance evidencing compliance with all requirements, and Licensee will promptly notify The Regents of any material modification of the insurance coverages.

Subject to such right to retain for archival purposes, each Receiving Party agrees to provide to the Disclosing Party, within thirty (30) days following termination of this Agreement, a written notice that Proprietary Information received from the Disclosing Party has been returned or destroyed.
